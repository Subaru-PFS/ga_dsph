Software to prepare and analyse PFS observations of dSphs
=========================================================

Usage
-----
* Get a github account and join the team Subaru-PFS/science-ga.
* Clone the directory to your machine, e.g. with `git clone git@github.com:Subaru-PFS/ga_dsph.git`
* Modify existing code and/or add your own software.
* `git add/commit/push` in order to share your updates with colleagues (see git documentation).


Best Practice Suggestions
-------------------------
* Please provide your code with a README file (or otherwise brief documentation).
* Ideally, provide some plotting scripts or other ways to illustrate the results or demonstrate the usage.
* Do not push big files to the git repository (about >10MB). Instead, provide instructions how users can obtain such files.
